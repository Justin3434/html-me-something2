<h2>Celtics</h2>
<p>Obviously number one on the list. They play basketball, the greatest sport
on earth. Plus, they have the most championships in the history of the NBA,
right behind the Lakers. Larry Bird, Bill Russell, Paul Pierce, and Kevin Garnett
just to name some of the greats that have played for them. I'll forever bleed green.</p>

<h2>Patriots</h2>
<p> Belicheck and Brady. Really the two names associated with excellence in football and
with the patriots. Definitely a very close second as 2001 was one of the greatest fan years of
my life. I completely wrote them off before the season, but then they won it all.

<h2>Bruins</h2>
<p>Less of a place in my heart as I'm not a huge hockey fan. However, it is still steeped in history
and cheering them on has always been fun,

<h2>Red Sox</h2>
<p>Right behind the patriots championship in 2001, the Red Sox winning the world series in 2004 was just
incredible. Finally breaking the curse and getting the monkey off their back was so cool.
